### Project Description
Ever felt like your smile was missing a score? Ever wanted a complex computer vision model to tell you just *how* happy you look? Introducing **Punchiri.App**‚Äîthe smile-detecting app that nobody asked for but you‚Äôll want to try anyway.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Are you feeling down? Is your smile a little crooked? Maybe you just need a robot to remind you how unconvincing that grin is. That‚Äôs where **Punchiri.App** steps in.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for, but you‚Äôll love anyway)
Punchiri.App uses not one, not two, but *three* sophisticated computer vision models to analyze and score your smile on a scale from "fake grin" to "beaming sunshine." Why, you ask? Because, sometimes, you just need a friendly reminder of how subpar (or amazing!) your smile is.
